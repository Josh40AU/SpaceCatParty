# Intro

This project is written in GScript from the open source game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). It was originally intended to be a collection of Mario Partyesque minigames, but for now, it is exclusively "Bug Squasher"

## Getting Started

To start, download [Godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/) and export the exe to anywhere on your computer. Start the application, and it should open a wizard to allow you to open the project in Godot's editor
